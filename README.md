# Covid-19-Analysis
My Very First Data Analysis Project!

About Covid-19:

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.

Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.

The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face. 

The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so it’s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).

At this time, there are no specific vaccines or treatments for COVID-19. However, there are many ongoing clinical trials evaluating potential treatments.

Data Analysis using Data Visualization Tools:
The aim here is to understand how visualization helps to derive informative insights from data sources.
For the visualization part, I am using Plotly. Plotly is a visualization tool available in python, and R which supports a number of interactive, high-quality graphs and is a great tool for data science beginners.

The data-set sources are accumulated, processed and latest updates are made available by “Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE)” in their github page (Given in Sources link below)
Terms of use: As stated by JHU CSSE in link. [Data to be used only for research purposes].
